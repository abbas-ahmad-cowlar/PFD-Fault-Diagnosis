--- PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS ---

✓ PRODUCTION READY: Excellent Performance

System Strengths:
  • High accuracy (95.33%) across all fault types
  • Strong per-class performance
  • Well-calibrated confidence scores
  • Good generalization capability

Deployment Recommendations:
  ✓ Deploy with confidence-based alerting
  ✓ Monitor for model drift (quarterly reviews)
  ✓ Collect edge cases for continuous improvement
  ✓ Establish feedback loop with maintenance teams

--- POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING PLAN ---

Weekly:
  • Review prediction confidence distributions
  • Analyze low-confidence cases
  • Check for unusual fault patterns

Monthly:
  • Evaluate model performance on production data
  • Update calibration if distribution shift detected
  • Review misclassification patterns

Quarterly:
  • Retrain model with accumulated production data
  • Re-evaluate feature importance
  • Update documentation and procedures

Trigger Conditions for Retraining:
  • Accuracy drop > 5% on production data
  • Mean confidence drop > 10%
  • New fault patterns emerge
  • Significant sensor/hardware changes
